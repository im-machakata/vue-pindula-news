*I used [Scraping Ant](//scrapingant.com) to fetch News, Jobs & Market Products. These guys offer 10,000 free credits per month, which I thought was more than enough for a project this small. I'd appreciate it if you do not abuse my credits for other uses, but rather create your own account if you need their services. Aw and one more thing, I am not paid by [Scraping Ant](scrapingant.com) for any of this.*

## About

While learning Vue JS 3, I decided to make a small clone project of our popular local news site [Pindula](//zero.pindula.co.zw).

**NB**: I am still learning hos to restructure & refactor the codebase though.

## Features

Since it's just a small project most of the features will / might be introduced a bit later as I do not have my whole focus on it.

### Working Features

- View latest news
- Read news

### Features Still to Come

- View comments
- View Jobs
- View Sponsored Ads
- View Market Products
- Reply to news / comments

I probably won't do anything more than this.

### Endpoints

## Collaborations

Well, that's pretty much the reason why I open sourced it, go ahead and grab a fork!
